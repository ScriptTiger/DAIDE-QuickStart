# DAIDE QuickStart
Replacement for the original `DAIDE QuickStart.exe`. This script helps you quickly and easily set up Diplomacy games, both local or networked games with any combination of bots and/or humans, with a variety of variants included.

**You can download the latest pre-bundled ScriptTiger package from the below link to get started right away:  
https://github.com/ScriptTiger/DAIDE-QuickStart/releases/download/1.0/DAIDE-QuickStart.zip**

The directory structure should be as follows:  
aimapper\  
aiserver\  
albert\  
DAIDE QuickStart.cmd  
holdbot\

**NOTES:**  
- For human players connecting over the network, they only need to install the AiMapper using the above link provided from David Norman.  
- Installing Jason van Hal's `DAIDE QuickStart` package using the above link is the same thing as installing the above AiServer, AiMapper, and Albert packages together. If you read Jason's `How to Play` (https://sites.google.com/site/diplomacyai/home/how-to-play), please ignore his `Installation Option 1` and `Installation Option 2`, as there is no need to install the same software twice.  
- The above directory structure is the default structure created when you install the `DAIDE QuickStart` package, except for `holdbot\` which provides the civil disorder functionality. Please ensure you install `HoldBot` separately using the above link provided from David Norman if you are not using a pre-bundled ScriptTiger package.  
- In order for the saving and loading of games to work correctly, you must ensure you are using a user account which has write access to the above directory structure.
